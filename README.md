# nvim-cfg

I've set up this config to run my favorite languages - Rust, Go, Python and Javascript. lol jk about Js.

Missing features:

* lua LSP should not mark the vim module;
* Dap config set to myCode false automatically;
* After Dap-ui is loaded, it binds <C-s> for opening all debug panes. I wan't to bind it to other keys;
* Jsonfly <leader-j> mapping to work only if json file is apened.
* telescope grep finder to look in dotfiles too
* loading only the LSPs that are nedded;
* debug using sinlge installation of debugpy;
* grammar errors highlighting;
